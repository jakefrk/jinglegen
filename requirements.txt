# The following are other dependencies that were present in pip freeze.
# They are often pulled in as transitive dependencies by the libraries above.
# Listing them ensures exact versions if there's any ambiguity or for very strict reproducibility.
# You can choose to comment them out if you prefer a more minimal requirements.txt
# focusing only on direct dependencies.

# certifi==2025.4.26 # Note: Version from freeze; if problematic, use 'certifi' or a standard recent version.
